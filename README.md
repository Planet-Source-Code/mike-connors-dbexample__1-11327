### Description

I got the the layout and design of the program

from CONTACTS 2000 made by Deatree@Yahoo.Com. BUT the

code underneath is radically different!

This program MANAGES AN ACCESS2000 DATABASE with SQL

and query's with Recordsets. The best part about using a

MS JETDB EnGINE4 is that the DB can be accessed through

a network. It also queies a recordset and spits the results

to the NEW DATA REPORT in VB6. I worked hard on this one!

enjoy. READ README.doc for info on running.

e-mail me at mikren@vianet.on.ca for questions.

PS. THANKS MICROSOFT SUPPORT (GENE MOODY)!
